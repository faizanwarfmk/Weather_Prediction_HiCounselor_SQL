Weather Forecasting Analysis & Visualization

We were given a dataset of 10 years. The dataset contained information of different factors of weather from 2022 till 2032. WE need to clean the file in order to derive insights from it.
•	Subtask 1: Correct years for given data set
•	Subtask 2: removal of duplicate rows and duplicate Columns
•	Subtask 3: fix a few labels in the given data set
•	Subtask 4: Encoding data into suitable format
The dataset we used in this project was populated using a scraping technique, the encoding method may be different we prefer UTF-8 encoding as it is majorly used in all the database servers. To do so, perform the below tasks:

1. In the menu bar of excel, select option data. Then select from text/CSV and choose the file in which you made changes using excel

2. The default file origin will be UTF -8. Keep all the field as it is and select load

3. Save the file as CSV(comma-delimited) file.

4. Import the file into your SQL database (Analyze the dataset with respect to your database system and then change it, if necessary).
Go through the datasets for a perfect understanding:
Since you have analyzed the complete data set accurately, Let's answer the following requirements to proceed further for a better understanding
1.	Give the count of the minimum number of days for the time when temperature reduced
2.	Find the temperature as Cold / hot by using the case and avg of values of the given data set
3.	Can you check for all 4 consecutive days when the temperature was below 30 Fahrenheit
4.	Can you find the maximum number of days for which temperature dropped
5.	Can you find the average humidity average from the dataset
( NOTE:should contain the following clauses: group by, order by, date )
6.	Use the GROUP BY clause on the Date column and make a query to fetch details for average windspeed ( which is now windspeed done in task 3 )
7.	Please add the data in the dataset for 2034 and 2035 as well as forecast predictions for these years
( NOTE:data consistency and uniformity should be maintained )
8.	If the maximum gust speed increases from 55mph, fetch the details for the next 4 days
9.	Find the number of days when the temperature went below 0 degrees Celsius
10.	Create another table with a “Foreign key” relation with the existing given data set.
